//## Task 3:
//Visit [this list of operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp) and play around in the console using all the different operators. Think of yourself as a mad scientist in a lab playing with crazy chemicals that might blow up. üß™üßë‚Äçüî¨ The only way to find out what happens is to give it a go!

// Make some variables that are numbers, strings, and booleans. Have a go at building on what you've done before. Mash them together, and tear them apart. Add a string to a number, minus a number from a boolean - go mad! If anything weird happens (and it will!), make a note of what it was and why you think its happening. We can then explain it or add it to our quirk bank, and the mysteries will be revealed in time!

let num = 2003;

let remainder = (num %= 2);
console.log(remainder);

//Oh like...directly in the console... I'm failing at that away from the browser.
